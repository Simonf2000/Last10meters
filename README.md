# Last10meters

GPS systems for blind people can provide useful guidance for most of the journey. However, currently available systems are not accurate enough to guide the user the last short distance (10 metres or so) to the entrance. An environmental information beacon could be placed at the entrance and guide the use, with for instance an infrared signal. However, these beacons are not widely used. Therefore, a technological solution, preferably in the form of an app on the user's phone or other mobile device, is required to solve this problem. The following is required of the app: 

• Compute an appropriate path from the user's currentlocation to the target entrance. 
• Guiding the user along this path to the target entrance, using appropriate sensors 
• Using appropriate sensors to identify and safely avoid obstacles and hazards along the path.
• Obtaining crowd-sourced information about the local area and using it to determine a safe path and the appropriate entrance if there is more than one.
• Have a user friendly interface with speech and gesture input and speech, non-speech audio and haptic output. Individual students will investigate, develop to 
  prototype level and, if time permits, test with endusersone (or more) of the following: • An appropriate guideance algorithm and combination of sensors to guide 
  the user to the target entrance while avoiding obstacles and hazards. • Different designs of end-user interface
• A crowd-sourcing algorithm
